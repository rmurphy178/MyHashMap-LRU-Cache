# MyHashMap-LRU-Cache

Phase 1: IntSet
a. Max Integer Set
b. Integer Set
c. Resizing Integer Set
  
Phase 2: Hashing

Phase 3: HashSet

Phase 4: Linked List

Phase 5: HashMap
-implemented with linked lists as hash buckets in place of arrays
  
Phase 6: LRU Cache
-Combines hash map and linked list data structures to allow O(1) lookup, insertion and deletion for cache
  
Phase 7: Dynamic Array
-dynamic resizing for amortized O(1) push and pop operations
-incorporates circular buffer principles to enable shift and unshift operations in O(1) time while minimizing space usage
